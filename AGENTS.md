# Agent Rules (Repo Local)

These rules apply to any Codex or agentic work on this repository.

## Required Behavior

1. Think hard before changing code. Identify root causes, not just symptoms.
2. Prefer the latest stable versions of dependencies unless there is a documented compatibility reason to pin older versions.
3. Avoid deprecated APIs, commands, and tooling workflows. Use current best practices for Expo, React Native, and TypeScript.
4. Verify platform-specific constraints (iOS, Android, Metro, Expo) and confirm path handling for directories with spaces.
5. When introducing fixes, update the relevant documentation with the reasoning and exact changes.

## Documentation Order

Read these before implementing changes:
1. docs/context/DECISIONS.md
2. docs/context/PLANS.md
3. docs/context/PRD.md
4. README.md
